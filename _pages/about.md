Hello! I'm a recent Master's graduate from Dartmouth College. Previously, I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Amherst College.

My research interests broadly are in AI safety and alignment. I'm interested in finding hidden biases in AI systems and exploring ways to minimize their harm.

I'm currently preparing to apply to PhD programs for Fall 2026.
